#summary Connecting Heart Rate Belt to GCC

= Introduction =

You can connect a common (5.3kHz) heart rate belt to GCC. In order to do so you must feed the 5.3kHz pulses into the microphone input of your device.

= Details =

The simplest way is to replace the microphone of a head set with a coil and place it close to the heart rate belt. The coil can be a small ferrite rod coil or a single wire loop with a diameter of about 40mm.  Use the signals strength indicator to find an optimal position.

With a selective amplifier circuit and a powerful antella coil (50 turns, 40mm diameter) it is possible to get over a distance of 1m.
