        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This is a GPS tracking
        application for Windows Mobile. You do not need any other
        GPS software to be installed, i.e. it works directly with
        Windows GPS driver. You do not need any data network
        connection to record a log, although there is an option
        to activate Live Logging (provided by </font><a

        face="Arial">www.crossingways.com</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial">), so your position is uploaded to
        the web site as well.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The tool logs GPS data
        into binary files with .gcc extension (binary files are
        much smaller than the text files to store the same
        information). gcc files then can be loaded back for
        viewing, or saved into .kml or .gpx format, to view in
        e.g. GoogleEarth. With the latest version of GoogleMaps,
        you can view kml files on your phone. Just click on a kml
        file in File Explorer. Note there is a bug in GoogleMaps
        installation, unless you install it into the main memory
        - see section &quot;Useful info&quot; below how to fix
        this.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">To save battery power, GPS
        can be switched on/off at pre-defined intervals (5 sec
        ... 1 hours). This has a drawback because the first
            samples from GPS after switch on are usually not very precise. Therfore there is
            an option to "Drop first: none .. 32 points".</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Main display shows: trip
        distance; trip time (including or excluding &quot;stop
        time&quot;, i.e. when speed is zero); current / average /
        max speed; altitude (abs or relative to starting point and altitude gain, that
            means increasing altitude is summarized);
        heading; estimated battery usage. Display units are miles
        / nautical miles / km for distance, m / feet for
        altitude, mph / kmh / knots / minpmile / minpkm for
        speed.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Map display shows your
        track. Also you can use &#147;maps&#148; &#150; any JPEG
        image with known coordinates of the corners as a
        background. OpenStreetMap &quot;tiles&quot; are supported
        - these can be downloaded automatically (if you are
        connected to the internet), or you can download a set of
        &quot;tiles&quot; yourself and copy them on your phone.
        You can also load a &quot;track-to-follow&quot; from gcc,
        kml or gpx file, which is displayed in different color.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
                The tool runs on mobile phones or PDAs with operating system Windows Mobile 5.0
                and above. On Windows for Pocket PC 2003 you need to install ".Net Compact Framework
                2.0".<br />
                GCC needs a touch screen and a GPS device, either internal or external (also bluetooth)
                as long as it is accessible via COM port.<br />
                Screen resolutions are tested from 240x240 to 480x800.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Copy the
        GpsCycleComputer.CAB file into your Windows Mobile device
        and click on it from your phone FileExplorer to install.
        The tool can be installed into any folder, so probably it is better to install it on "Storage
            Card" or into &quot;Internal
        Storage&quot;, to save main memory. The path to the tool
        (on UK Windows) will be then \Internal Storage\Program
        Files\GpsCycleComputer. You can also find this Readme.htm
        file in that folder, if you want to read it on your
        phone.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The tool shall work on any
        screen resolution in portrait or in landscape mode. It was designed on a
        VGA screen, so you might have small distortions on other
        screens due to scaling. For landscape mode, the buttons are moved to the
            right to save space in order to keep the layout basically the same.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The tool now supports
        AppToDate, i.e. if you have AppToDate installed on your
        phone (get it from here </font><a

        and the info you would see on a GPS device: altitude,
        heading, latitude/longitude, plus some info about the GPS
        status. At the bottom there are 3 buttons: Menu
        (left), Start (center) and GPS (right). These 3 buttons
        changes as you move to different screens or start/stop
        GPS.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In most cases you shall be
        able just to click Start button, get GPS lock (so it is
        better to try this outside! ) and record you first track.
        Find an open place outside (which is not surrounded by
        trees or buildings), click the Start button and stay
        still (this helps to get GPS lock). You need to watch:</font></p>

                time is behind. What is important, is when the
                number is increasing, then the GPS cannot get
                hold on a fresh sample (i.e. searching) </font></li>

        correctly, see section &quot;Useful info&quot;, &quot;GPS
        setup&quot; below.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Assuming that all works
        (you see "GPS: on&quot; and green rectangle) with the
        default settings (or if you have changed the setting, and
        it works!) , let us proceed with the desciption of the
        main screen.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When running, Start button
        changes to Pause - to pause GPS. Press Pause button again to continue logging. The GPS button changes to Stop
            - to stop the log. The Menu button changes to Maps - which shows your track. Remember
            you can always get to the Menu by long-click (or double-click) on left button. On the Maps screen,
        you can use Zoom in / Zoom out buttons, and move track
        line with your finger (like in GoogleMaps for Mobile).
        Also you can plot a &quot;map&quot; as a background for
        the track - see section &quot;Maps&quot; how to do that.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When GPS is on, the
        tool will prevent your phone going into standby mode
        (note, the standby time has to be larger than 15 sec), so
        the screen shall be always on. By default, you can use
        the hardware &quot;power&quot; button to switch off the
        screen &#150; GPS will continue logging. On some devices
            this switches off also the GPS receiver, so track logging is no more possible. Then
            you can try to check the option "GPS | use alternate method to keep GPS on". This modifies
            some values in the registry while gps is on. If this doesn't solve the problem you
            can enable the option "Main screen | Show BKLight Off button" and use this button
            to switch off backlight instead of the power button.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When logging, if your
        current speed is not 0, you shall see &quot;heading&quot;
        (blue arrow at the bottom right of the main screen or in
            center of map screen). This
        shows direction of your travel, as it looks on a map with
        &quot;north&quot;, as usual on a map, pointing up. Do not
        be confised - the arrow shows direction of your travel,
        not the &quot;north&quot; direction (north is up).<br />
            Hint: if you rotate your device so that the arrow points in direction of your movement,
            the device top points to north.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, if you have any data
        logged, you can stop the logging (press Stop button), and
        see what you can do with the log file.</font></p>

        save file as KML or GPX before viewing them in other
        applications. When you save file into KML, a
        &quot;*&quot; is printed before the file name. If you
        save into GPX, then a &quot;+&quot; is printed - so you
        can quickly check which files have been converted into
        GPX and/or KML.</font></p>

        and also if you have the tool already opened, it does not
        load another file again (i.e. you need to close it, to
        get it load a file). If you know how to fix this - please
        let me know. So at the moment this seems not a very
        usable option to open gcc files (i.e. better to load them

            </h2>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The most powerful and most convenient method of using
            maps is to use OSM-type maps, described in chapter 10.4.</font></p>
            <p>
                <font face="Arial" size="2">A &#147;map&#148; is any
        JPEG image with known coordinates of the corners. It is
        plotted as a background on &#147;Maps&#148; page. Maps
        are automatically selected &#150; the map which has
        better coverage of the picture (in % of the picture area)
        and higher resolution (lower km per pixel) is selected.
        Also there is a option to plot multiple maps at the same
        time - read below how it is implemented.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">So first you need a jpeg
        image, the file must have .jpg or .jpeg extension, e.g.
        &#147;MyTown.jpg&#148;. Do not create very large images,
        as it takes long time to load and plot them - a good size
        is about 1000x1000 max. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">To specify the map
        coordinates, you can use 3 methods described below. Also
        you can use &quot;OpenStreetMap tiles&quot; - these are
        specially created PNG images, so the image coordinates
        can be derived from the file names. I.e. you do not need
        to specify the coordinates for OpenStreetMap tiles - just
        download them.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong><u>10.1 txt + jpeg:
        first method</u></strong> is to create a text file (with
        .txt extension and the same name as the image, e.g.
        &#147;MyTown.txt&#148;) which contains 4 lines: 1st line
        - latitude of the bottom left corner, 2nd line &#150;
        longitude of the bottom left corner, 3rd line - latitude
        of top right corner, 4th line &#150; longitude of the top
        right corner. The lat/long must be in decimal format,
        e.g. 55.976598, just the decimal number, no degrees
        character, etc. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">You need to place the <strong>jpg
        and txt</strong> files into folder with your maps. By
        default, this is the &#147;maps&#148; subfolder where
        GpsCycleComputer executable is installed on your phone,
        e.g. if you install into &#147;Internal Storage&#148;,
        then the default location (on English Windows) will be:
        &#147;\Internal Storage\Program
        Files\GpsCycleComputer\maps&#148;. This folder is created
        during CAB installation and has a text file
        &#147;maps_folder.txt&#148; inside, so you shall be able
        to identify it easily. Note that you can change the maps
        location in Options. The tool supports up to 512
        &#147;maps&#148; per folder.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong><u>10.2 kml + jpeg:
        second method</u></strong> is to use GoogleEarth to
        create maps, it is quick and accurate. A very good and
        detailed description how to create such a map is given in
        the RunGps manual, section 5.2.2 (look at
        http://www.rungps.net/wiki/DownloadsEN). The only
        difference is that you need to save location as
        &#147;.kml&#148; file, not as &#147;.kmz&#148; file used
        by RunGps. If you already have a .kmz file, then it is
        easy to convert it to .kml: simple change the .kmz
        extension into .zip (this is a zip file), and unzip it
        &#150; the unzipped file will be the .kml.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">So here are the main
        steps: </font></p>
        <ul>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Start GoogleEarth and
                select the area to be used as a map. </font></li>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Make sure that the
                &#147;Terrain&#148; layer is OFF, otherwise the
                map will be distorted (the layers are shown in
                the side bar) </font></li>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Make sure the map is
                not rotated, i.e. the north is up. Press
                &#147;r&#148; (in English version) to
                &#147;reset&#148; any rotations. </font></li>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial">You can also switch
                on grid (Ctrl-L), to check that the map is not
                rotated &#150; but better to save picture without
                grid. </font></li>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Save the image
                (Ctrl-Alt-S) as a jpeg file. </font></li>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Now add a placemark
                (Ctrl-Shift-P), do not move/edit it, just press
                OK to put it in the centre of the image. </font></li>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Save this location
                (Ctrl-S), select &#147;.kml&#148; file, and give
                it the same name as the .jpg file for the map. </font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This is it! As with the
        txt files, you need to place the <strong>jpg and kml</strong>
        files into folder with your maps (by default, this is the
        &#147;maps&#148; subfolder where GpsCycleComputer
        executable is installed).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Here is my interpretation
        how this works for kml files: The .kml file is just a
        text file. It contains the coordinate of the map centre
        (LookAt point) and the height of the &#147;eye&#148; This
        is a single point, but as I understand, the default angle
        of view along the horizontal (x-axis) is 60 degrees, so
        knowing the height of the &#147;eye&#148; and this view
        angle allows to determine the map size along x-axis. As
        we know the picture size in pixels, then we can determine
        the y-size of the map. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong><u>10.3 gmi + jpeg:
        third method</u></strong> is to use GpsTuner' <strong>gmi</strong>
        files. Instead of the coordinates of the map' corners,
        you can supply coordinates of a few reference points
        (e.g. a bridge or road intersection). gmi file is a text
        file which contains the following lines:</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">First line is the header
        (must be present, otherwise an error dialog is shown).
        Second line is the image file name. It is not used by
        GpsCycleComputer, as the gmi and jpg file <u>must</u>
        have the same name. Lines 3-4 are the image width/height
        - these must match the image size, otherwise an error
        dialog is shown. This is an important check, as if the
        image size does not match these values, then the lines
        below will be incorrect, as they give location of the
        reference point on the image. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The format of these lines
        with reference points is: 4 values separated by
        &quot;;&quot; - the x and y point location on the image
        (in pixels), then longitude and latitude of the point.
        You could have a few reference points/lines, but not less
        than 2. Note that the &quot;y&quot; coordinate in pixels
        is calculated from the image top, not from the bottom -
        e.g. if you load your image into Windows Paint, and move
        mouse over it watching the mouse position display, you
        will see that the image origin is the top left corner,
        not the bottom left. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Note that the map must not
        be rotated, i.e. the north must be up (as with all other
        maps used by GpsCycleComputer).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As with the txt and kml
        files, you need to place the <strong>jpg and gmi</strong>
        files into folder with your maps (by default, this is the
        &#147;maps&#148; subfolder where GpsCycleComputer
        executable is installed).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A similar idea to set the
        map coordinates is used in OziExplorer map files and

        arranged into a special directory structure based on
        &quot;zoom level&quot; (0 to 18), and the tile X
        coordinate within this zoom level. The image Y coordinate
        is the file name. More info is here: </font><a

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As an example, assume that
        you have a directory &quot;tiles&quot;, then first you
        will see sub-folders with names &quot;0&quot; to
        &quot;18&quot; (this is the zoom level, not all
        directories will be there, i.e. you will see the level
        which you have downloaded). Then inside each sub-folder
        you will see more sub-folders, each has name as a number
        - these are the X-coordinates of the tiles. And fnally,
        you will see the .PNG files itself - the file name is the
        Y-coordinate. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">To use tile files in
        GpsCycleComputer, you need to select the top folder, i.e.
        the folder &quot;tiles&quot; in the above example, the
        one which have sub-directories 0 to 18. Note that you <u>should
        not change the directory structure</u> (then you will get
        incorrect tile coordinates), or to <u>place any other
        files there</u> (they will not be loaded, i.e. only the
        PNG files will be used).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">                
        Since version 4.3 GCC supports other image formats in OSM style maps. Besides .png
        also .jpg .bmp .gif .exif .tiff are supported. But all images of the whole map must
        be of the same type. You can have separate maps with different formats in different
        directories.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There is no limit on the
        number of tiles (just the size of you phone's storage
        card!). The large number of tiles will not slow the tool
        or increase the memory usage - as only the tiles which
        are required are loaded for plotting.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are a few tools to
        download tiles, I tried &quot;JTileDownloader&quot; which
        is available from here: </font><a

        size="2" face="Arial">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JTileDownloader</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial">.This is a Java tool
        (&quot;jar&quot; file), so if you click on it and nothing
        happens (on a PC), then you will need to download and
        install &quot;Jave runtime&quot; from Sun (just seach for
        it in Google). As you start JTileDownloader, on the
        &quot;Main&quot; page you can select zoom level(s) and
        the area you want to download. As the tiles are
        downloaded, they are automatically arranged in the
        directory tree described above - so all you need is to
        copy it to your mobile, and point GpsCycleComputer to the
        top folder (e.g. &quot;tiles&quot;). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">My favorite is another powerful tool <strong>"Mobile Atlas Creator"</strong>

        can create different map formats. The format<strong> "OSMTracker tile storage"</strong> is compatible
        to GCC. In some cases it may be advantageous to apply the "custom tile
            processing" for example to convert 170kB .png files into 25kB .jpg files (the x/y
            size must be kept at 256x256!).</font></p>

        missing and requried for display will be downloaded
        there. This way your &quot;tile collection&quot; will
        grow. Note that if a tile file already exist, then it
        will not be downloaded automatically.
            If you want to download the visible tiles

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong><u>10.7 Multi-maps
        plotting algorithm</u></strong> - tries to plot multiple
        jpeg maps (instead of a single, the best, map). The maps are simply plotted on the top of each other, so the trick
        is to decide in which order to plot the maps. Well, I
        have an idea to plot the maps in order of &quot;map
        quality&quot;- starting from the worst, and finishing
        with the best, so we have the best map on top. There are
        two factors which determine &quot;map quality&quot; -
        first is how much area of the screen is covered by the
        map (the best map will cover 100%). Second factor is what
        is map zoom level - clearly, there is a zoom level at
        which the map is best readable on the phone screen - this
        is selectable in options (you can choose 1x zoom, 2x zoom
        or 4x zoom). If the zoom level is different (i.e. if you
        zoom-in or zoom-out) - the map quality will drop (details
        are too fine and not possible to read, when you zoom-out,
        or, details dissappear as you zoom in more and more). So
        the map quality is defined as combination of map coverage
        and zoom quality factor. Well - this is probably too
        complicated to explain - but all you need is to
        experiment with different settings and see which one
        works best for you. Note that the more maps you use, the
        more memory is required.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Regarding what set of maps
        to create - I think the best idea to create maps for the
        same area at different zoom level (like OpenStreetMap
        tiles) - e.g. a overview map, then maps which cover some
        part in more and more details. Then the tool will try to
        select the best (or the best set of) maps for you. Do not
        create very large or very small images, the size is about
        1000x1000 max.</font></p>

        GpsCycleComputerSource.zip) and copy the new images into
        the folder with GpsCycleComputer.exe on your WinMobile,
        then re-start GpsCycleComputer. The new images will be
        loaded at the startup. If you want to change just a
        single button, just copy the files for that button, all
        files are not required. For example, if you want the
        change &#147;Maps&#148; button for bottom menu, edit
        files &#147;map.jpg&#148; and &#147;map_p.jpg&#148;
        (there are two images, as button has two states,
        &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;pressed&quot;). Better do
        not change the image sizes, to avoid image distortions.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By context menu (or double click) on the main screen in Speed field you can enable heart rate support
            and display heart rate below the speed. The configuration "speed + hr + signal" is intended for testing and shows also the signal strength.
                The heart rate can also be viewed in Graph over time or distance.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">You need a hardware to feed the pulses of a common heart rate belt into the microphone input of your device.
            The simplest way is to replace the microphone of a head set with a coil and place it close to the heart rate belt
                (use the signals strength indicator to find an optimal position). With an amplifier
                and filter circuit it is possible to get over a distance of 1m. For details

            - *.gpx or *.kml &nbsp; for tracks to follow<br />
            The shortcut file is best created on your desktop PC, for example with notepad and
            then copied to the device. It must have the extension .lnk. It is ASCII encoded and must include a hash (#), the application
            name and optional a parameter. In front of the hash
            is the number of characters after the hash (according my experience this number can be omitted.)<br />

        function &quot;LoadGcc&quot; which loads a gcc file.
        Basically after a header with general data, the data is
        written as 5 short int (short int = 16 bits = 2 bytes)
        which are : x, y, z (in metres, relative to starting
        point), speed (in kmh*10) and time (sec, relative to
        start). Also there are a few special records (also as 5
        short ints) to save some control info, like battery

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The project files for MS
        Visual Studio 2005 are provided. The solution file
        (*.sln) contains 3 projects: GccGPS (this is the dll to
        work with GPS - you need to build this for PocketPC 2003
        target, release); then GpsCycleComputer project itself
        (to build the executable - build for Any CPU, release);
        and the CAB project, the one which creates a CAB (build
        this last, for Any CPU, release). If
            you have problems with missing "Platform ID" you can open GpsCycleComputer.csproj
            in an editor and change the GUID of &lt;PlatformID&gt; to the GUID from a self created
            project. If you have further problems you could create a project yourself, and just add
        the existing source files to it. If you have problems
        building dll - I just use the Wizard to set a MFC DLL
        project for me (so you could try to do the same), then
        just add there GccGPS.cpp and .h. If this still does not
        work, then you actually do not need to build DLL, just
        copy it from the installation (after you install the
        application on your phone).</font></p>
        <h2><font size="3" face="Arial">16. Useful Info</font></h2>
        <h3><font size="2" face="Arial">16.1 GPS setup</font></h3>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are many ways for a
        software to connect to GPS. Usually it is assumed that
        the GPS hardware is connected to a serial port (e.g.
            COM0..COM12), so all is requried for a software is to
        &quot;open&quot; the required serial port and listen to
        the GPS data. The data comes in a form of text strings in
        so called NMEA format.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In <strong>addition</strong>,
        Windows provides two drivers to connect to GPS (you can
        read about this here: </font><a
        href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb201942.aspx"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb201942.aspx</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial">) - Windows &quot;raw&quot; GPS
        driver and Windows &quot;parsed&quot; driver.
        &quot;Raw&quot; driver is also called
        &quot;multiplexer&quot;, as it does not do any processing
        of the GPS data, but simply forwards it to all
        applications, i.e. multiple tools can be connected to GPS
        at the same time. The COM port for the &quot;raw&quot;
        driver is different from the GPS hardware port, and it is
        set in Windows &quot;Settings&quot;, &quot;System&quot;,
        &quot;External GPS&quot;, &quot;Programs&quot; tab - this
        is usually COM4 (in WinMobile 6.1). The
        &quot;parsed&quot; driver does more work for you - it
        converts GPS data into actual latitude/longitude, etc, so
        you can just retrieve this data without any knowledge of
        a COM port or NMEA strings generated by GPS.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">So how all this can be set
        in the tool? There is a check box &quot;read GPS data
        directly&quot;, COM port and baud rate selectors on
        Options page.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Option 1 (default
        and recommended)</strong>: Check (i.e. select) &quot;read
        GPS data directly&quot;, set COM port to the multiplexer
        value (check Windows &quot;Settings&quot;,
        &quot;System&quot;, &quot;External GPS&quot;,
        &quot;Programs&quot; tab - usually this is COM4), baud
        rate does not matter (I think) for multiplexer, set to
        e.g. 4800. This way you use Windows &quot;raw&quot;
        driver, and let multiple apps to use GPS at the same
        time.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Option 2 (very
        easy, but often GPS does not work well):</strong>
        Un-check (un-select) &quot;read GPS data directly&quot;,
        the COM/baud rate setting are not used in this case. This
        way you use Window &quot;parsed&quot; driver and let
        Windows fully manage and process GPS data for you. Note:
        with this option you <strong>cannot</strong> use the
        phone hardware power off button to switch the phone
        on/off, and still have the GPS logging - you will need to
        use BkLightOff button - to switch the
        bklight off.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Option 3:</strong>
        Check (select) &quot;read GPS data directly&quot;, set
        COM port and baud rate to the GPS hardware port setting
        (you shall have some instructions from the GPS
        manufacturer). This way you are connected to the GPS
        directly. Not sure if this will work correctly with
        multiple GPS applications running at the same time. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">You shall be getting at
        least 1 satellite very quickly (see main screen display,
        GPS section, parameter &quot;S&quot;), if the settings
        are correct. If you have 0 satellites or &quot;no gps
        data&quot; for some time - then something might be wrong
        in your setup.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Tips for a quick
        GPS lock</strong>: 1) use QuickGPS tool (it is supplied
        with Diamond); 2) do soft-reset for your phone, specially
        after software updates; 3) find a place outside building
        with clear sky view (i.e. do not stay next to a large
        building wall); 4) do not move your phone, keep it still
        relative to ground (not relative to your car dashboard
        while you are driving off !). On Diamond, in this
        conditions, usually you will get a lock in under 30 sec.</font></p>
            <p>
                <font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Initialization of GPS Receiver</strong>: If you
                    need to initialize your GPS receiver you can place a file "\GccInitGps.txt" in the
                    root directory of your device. If this file exists, its content is sent to the GPS
                    receiver on every open of the GPS.</font></p>
        <h3><font size="2" face="Arial">16.2 Logging raw (NMEA) data from GPS device</font></h3>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
                By context menu on the main screen in GPS field you can enable "log raw nmea" data.
                When enabled this logs raw NMEA data from the GPS device and some status information
                in the file \tmp.txt in the root directory of your device (this option is not stored
                non volatile; you must switch off and on gps to have changes an effect).</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
                This NMEA data can be useful for
                evaluation and bug fixing. If the file is renamed to nmea.txt you can choose this file instead of the COM port to use this data as input for the application.
                So you can test the application indoor with previous recorded GPS data.</font></p>

                    open KML file</font></h3>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There is a problem with
        some versions of GoogleMaps for Mobile - it cannot open a
        KML file as you click on it in your phone File Explorer.
        You need to edit registry key to fix this. If you do not
        know how to edit a registry key, then a simple solution
        would be to install GoogleMaps into main memory - then it
        shall work. If you have experience with registry, then go
        to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, &quot;kml&quot; key (without .
        upfront, as there is a key called &quot;.kml&quot;).
        Inspect the path to your GoogleMaps.exe, it could be
        wrong - usually the part &quot;Internal Storage&quot; (on
        UK Windows) is missing - this is what you need to add. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Note that you shall <strong>not</strong>
        use any tools to associate kml file with GoogleMaps, as
        these tools do not know about extra command-line switches
        (e.g. -KML_FILE) required, i.e. they create incorrect
        association and you still will not be able to open KML
        files.</font></p>

            In most cases you will get a warning that EOF has reached and default settings are
